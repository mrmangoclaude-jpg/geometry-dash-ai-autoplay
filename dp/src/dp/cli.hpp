// leveldp -- exact-representative layered reachability solver (cube + ship).
//
// First target: lv1 (Stereo Madness): cube -> ship -> cube -> ship, no pads,
// no orbs, no speed changes, nothing grouped/moving.
//
// Architecture: forward layered search over ticks. States are EXACT
// (double y, vy + mode/held/grounded); a per-layer hash keyed by quantized
// (y, vy) only DEDUPES (first representative wins) -- it never snaps state.
// Surviving paths are therefore exactly simulatable input plans; the DP is a
// candidate generator and the final proof is a plain GD replay of the witness
// (project rule).
//
// Sound under-approximations:
//   - ship: any solid contact excludes the branch (no floor/ceiling rides)
//   - cube: solids can only be stood on from above; inner-box side contact
//     kills; ceilings kill
//
// Measured constants (2026-07-30):
//   cube: gravity -0.216/tick, jump vy=11.18 (jump tick: vy set, y frozen),
//         terminal -15, rest at surface top + 15, floor clamp y=105
//   ship: ShipModel::stepVy (bit-exact), box 30x30
//   both: y += 0.225 * vy, dx = 1.29825 (speed 0.9), input latency +2 ticks
//
// usage: leveldp <objrects.csv> [--out plan.txt]
//
// This is the command-line front end as a FUNCTION. It is compiled once (dp/src/dpcore.cpp),
// the mod links that compiled code and calls dp::cliMain in-process, so there is exactly one
// solver entry point: whatever the CLI does with a level, the mod does with it too, in the same
// order and with the same code. leveldp.exe is a three-line main() around this.

    // Sound for the same reason as the counter, and gated on the same fact: x
    // only grows in frame 0, so once every switch-on box is behind the player
    // and none of them has fired, that coin can never come back. The test also
    // asks whether the coin is off RIGHT NOW (it is absent from the live rows
    // when its group is) -- without that, a coin that is on by default and
    // merely has an enabling Toggle somewhere would be pruned for never having
    // needed it.
    //
    // Only a Toggle that is the ROOT of its chain is seen here (togOn is read
    // off the root row). A switch-on nested inside a spawn chain would not be,
    // and the branch would keep the old behaviour -- late, not wrong.
    // ---- WHAT A FIRED CHAIN ADDS TO AN ITEM COUNTER ------------------------
    // The counter used to be "collectibles the player has physically touched"
    // (g_collect, which loadCollectibles fills from the rows with pickup=1).
    // On lv22's first coin that counter can never move: the gate is
    // `item 2 == 5`, and all three rows that give item 2 have pickup=0 --
    // they are Pickup triggers (1817) and a collectible (1816) that a TOUCH BOX
    // spawns, so nothing is ever touched. The gate could not fire, the coin was
    // never raised, and the model was not choosing the low lane over the high
    // one: IT HAD NO HIGH LANE. Closing the low band with --deadband made it go
    // lower still (under the coin, between the two spikes) rather than up.
    //
    // So count what the FIRED CHAINS give as well. The per-bit table is static:
    // g_itemGiver holds every row that names an item, touchable or not, and a
    // box's ctl list is what its chain reaches. No new state -- s.trig already
    // says which boxes have fired.
    //
    // MULTIPLICITY IS TAKEN FROM THE CTL LIST, and the game agrees on both
    // boxes it was asked about. A uid reached by two paths appears twice there,
    // and whether GD's counter moves once or twice for that is the game's
    // answer to give (cfg coins=1 prints `itemcnt:`). Dropped onto each box in
    // turn, lv22 says:
    //
    //   box uid 18090   weight 1   itemcnt v=1, still 1 fourteen ticks later
    //   box uid 2195    weight 2   itemcnt v=1 at the touch, v=2 at +25 ticks
    //
    // THE SECOND INCREMENT IS LATE, which a first reading missed: that box was
    // measured on a run that died nine ticks in and reported 1, and a walk of
    // the same chains written independently said 3 for the first box. Both were
    // wrong and the ctl list was right -- so the weights are measured, and the
    // number to distrust is a counter read from a run that ended too early.
    //
    // The line below prints what the model derives, so any level can be put
    // beside its `itemcnt:` the same way. On lv22 nine boxes feed item 2, 13 in
    // total, against a gate of 5. Under --itemsnoblock five boxes, 5 in total: the
    // other eight were the Collision Block uid 18154 on the ceiling every one of
    // those chains moves (g_itemsNoBlock) -- and GD's counter, taken on a pass
    // rather than a drop, agrees with the five.

    // hold: lv22's third coin opens at item 1 >= 6, six presses of the box at
    // x=15,525 before the Stop at x=15,765 (six confirmed in the game). So its

    // ---- CAN "THE PLAYER IS PAST IT" BE FINAL FOR THIS COIN? ---------------
    // Both prunes below -- the switch-on gate and the miss test -- say "behind
    // the player, so gone". That rests on the player never coming back, which
    // used to be asked of the LEVEL: no gameplay rotation anywhere, or neither
    // prune runs. lv22 turns the frame, so on the one level whose coins are
    // still missing, nothing pruned and a branch that skipped a coin flew to the
    // end for free. The level's own log says what that costs: fourteen runs
    // completed it with 0/3.
    //
    // It is a per-COIN question, and a static one. Collecting needs frame 0 (the
    // live coin rows are built only there -- in a turned frame xAbs is a
    // different axis), and inside frame 0 x only grows. So a coin is out of
    // reach for good once every LATER return to frame 0 happens further along
    // than the coin. The returns are known before the search starts: a 2900
    // carries the frame it SETS and its world position, and it is one-shot, so
    // the chain is a fixed sequence. Take the ones at or after the point the
    // coin is passed and ask for the smallest.
    //
    // The index is taken crudely -- the first rotation in chain order sitting
    // past the coin -- which can only pull in rotations that fire EARLIER than
    // the coin is passed. That makes the minimum smaller and the verdict more
    // conservative, never less.
    //
    // On lv22 this separates the three coins, and its "no" is independently
    // right: a recorded run comes back past c3 for 2,840 ticks and never returns
    // past c1 or c2, which is exactly what the rule says.
    //
    //   c1 (3,919)   smallest later return 6,875    prunable
    //   c2 (10,513)  smallest later return 15,015   prunable
    //   c3 (16,097)  smallest later return 15,015   NOT prunable
    // ...and a ROTATION is not the only way back. A ring or a pad carrying
    // property 117 (Obj::rev) turns the player round, so a coin with one of
    // those anywhere past it can still be taken on the way back, and "passing
    // it is final" is simply false. SubZero 4002: the first coin sits at
    // x=1,787 with reversing rings later in the level, and with the prune on

// Measured 2026-09-25 on the official lv1-15 from t=0 (one search each, the loop's cap 2000 as
// the reference): cap 125 reaches the end on 13 of 15 levels with 0.068-0.099 of the stepped
// children, and where it does not (lv11, lv12) the frontier dies at one or two narrow passages.
// Raising the cap over a window starting some distance BEFORE the passage gets through it
// (lv12: 1000 from >= 300 px before, not 100; lv11: 250 from >= 600 px), because the passage
// needs states that have to be kept on the way to it, not at it. Which cap a passage needs also
// depends on what the search kept earlier (lv11's second passage fails with 250 from x=12,111 to
// the end, and passes with 250 from 3,000 px before it), so each attempt is a whole search again
// rather than a resumed one.
//
// The attempts:
//   1. --cap c0 everywhere.
//   2. The frontier died at x_w: add a window [x_w - 600, x_w + 300] at 4 * c0, search again.
//   3. Died inside a window again: that window's cap x4 (at most --cap) and its lead x2. Died
//      outside every window: a new window at the new wall. Windows are kept, since each attempt
//      starts from t0.
//   4. Died inside a window that already has the full --cap, or more than kLadderMaxAttempts
//      attempts: the plain search with the caller's own arguments, i.e. exactly what runs
//      without the flag. Also straight after an attempt whose alive cap never bound (capHits
//      0): the attempts after it only raise caps, and a cap no layer reaches cuts nothing (the
//      layer loop truncates only a layer over it), so each would be that search again. In the
//      official levels with coins, 311 of the ladders' 764 attempts came after one.
//   5. The plain search's frontier died too, on an EARLIER tick than the deepest attempt's did:
//      that attempt is searched again (the first attempt to reach that tick, with its own map)
//      and its result is the ladder's. The alive cap is not monotone -- measured 2026-09-26 with
//      --heldall, the plain cap-2000 search died at lv21 t=1,961 and lv19 t=2,317 where the
//      ladder's attempts had reached t=13,930 and t=11,350 -- and without this step the ladder
//      handed back the shallower plan. "Deeper" is the tick the frontier died on (deepT), not x,
//      which runs backwards in a reversed section; on a tie the plain search's result stands.
//      A death is still a death either way (PARTIAL/FAILED): this picks which one, not whether.
// Anything that is not a frontier death (SOLVED, a horizon cut, CANCELLED, an early return)
// ends the ladder with that attempt's result. Every attempt writes the same output files, so
// the last search's are the ones left behind -- which is why step 5 searches again rather than
// keeping copies: the plan, its trace and g_outcome all come from that one search.
//
