// the model answers what one tick does to a state. These are the model's half of that line:
// the world a call plans in (ModelWorld), what one group of states shares for one tick
// (GroupEnv, built by prepareGroup), and one state's tick (advanceState). The search's layer
// loop (cli.hpp) calls them; it reads the physics through nothing else.
//
// A group is a set of states that share the tick's geometry: the same x advance, the same
// touch boxes fired, the same gameplay frame and direction. They are stepped against one set
// of windows, so the windows are built once per group.

// One gameplay frame's x-sorted views of the level (see RotTrig). Frame 0 is the level as loaded;
// the others are built on first use. The cursors are monotone in that frame's travel coordinate, so
// a group whose window starts BEHIND where the cursor already is has to rewind -- states in one
// frame are no longer guaranteed to advance together once a turn splits them.
